<p>Where applicable, an interjection can be pronounced with a rising intonation to inquire about the interlocutor’s mental state regarding the interjection. For instance, one might say <span class="toaq">áhı</span>? “did that hurt?” after seeing the other person stub their toe.</p>

<p>More interjections are still developing organically as the language is being used more. This list is merely an incomplete snapshot and is expected to grow as time goes on.</p>
