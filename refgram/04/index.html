<p>The tones introduced in the last section all have very specific functions. Their job is to specify to which part of speech a given word belongs. Each tone corresponds to a different part of speech. </p>

  <table class="tones">
    <tr>
      <th>Symbol</th>
      <th>Name</th>
      <th>Function</th>
    </tr>
    <tr>

<p>Toaq's tones are syntactic heads, which head a phrase of their respective type. They precede their complement, but since tones are suprasegmental features, they need a segment as carrier. Therefore, they end up "on top" of their complement.</p>

<p>The first six tones apply exclusively to verbs and verbal particles. Any verb can carry any of those six tones, and each tone produces a different part of speech.</p>

<p>On the other hand, the neutral tone can only appear in particles. A verbal lexeme can never carry the neutral tone.</p>

<p>The following table shows what the verbal lexeme <span class="toaq">juqgı</span> "to  be beneficial to someone" would mean in each tonal inflection:</p>

  <table class="tones">
    <tr>
      <td><img class="tn" src="../../assets/images/tones/t2.png"> + <span class="toaq">juqgı</span></td>
      <td>"the beneficial thing"</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td><img class="tn" src="../../assets/images/tones/t3.png"> + <span class="toaq">juqgı</td>
      <td>"... which is beneficial"</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td><img class="tn" src="../../assets/images/tones/t4.png"> + <span class="toaq">juqgı</td>
      <td>"to be beneficial"</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td><img class="tn" src="../../assets/images/tones/t5.png"> + <span class="toaq">juqgı</td>
      <td>"that (something) is beneficial"</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td><img class="tn" src="../../assets/images/tones/t6.png"> + <span class="toaq">juqgı</td>
      <td>"benefitting [complement]"</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td><img class="tn" src="../../assets/images/tones/t7.png"> + <span class="toaq">juqgı</td>
      <td>"beneficially"</td>
    </tr>
  </table>



<p>Unlike the tones found in many natural languages, where a different tone signifies a different lexical entry, the tones in Toaq never change the lexical content of a word, so even if a speaker were to get the tones wrong, the listener would still get a rough idea of what the sentence is about and would only have to guess how the different parts are related syntactically.</p>
